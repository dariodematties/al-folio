This is my postdoctoral project. In this I am trying to achieve self-supervised learning in vision using contrastive learning.
Yet, in this project I am using foveated fixations as a natural augmentation method.

To that end I designed my own active foveated system using [NVIDIA DALI](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DALI) library.

This is a fixation output from my foveated saccadic system.


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/Ele_1.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/Ele_2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/Ele_3.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    The smaller the section of the cropped image, the bigger the resolution. Just like in our retina, the larger the span, the lower the resolution. Highest resolution is located in a tini section of the retina called fovea.

    This system mimics such phenomenon and images have to be scanned by the system by means of several fixations.

## Some of the big questions here are

* Is this foveated system paramount to acquire good visual representations in our visual system?

* How does it affect our perception of the world and our production and processing of higher cognitive phenomena such as language?
